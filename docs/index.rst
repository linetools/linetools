Linetools
=========

linetools is an in-development package for the analysis of 1-D
spectra, with the aim to become an `Astropy`_ `affiliated package
<http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html>`_. Its core developers
work primarily on UV/optical/IR absorption line research, so most of the
functionality is aimed at the identification and analysis of
absorption lines. The eventual goal is to provide a set of tools
useful for both absorption and emission lines.


.. note::

    linetools is still under active development. While the developers
    strive to maintain compatibility in new releases, there may
    backwards-incompatible changes in future versions.
