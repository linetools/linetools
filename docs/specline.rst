Overview
========

This Class is designed to organize and analyze an spectral line,
either emission or absorption. This is an abstract base class,
i.e. one must instantiate one of its subclasses (e.g. AbsLine).

Sub Classes
===========

The primary children of SpectralLine are
:ref:`AbsLine` and EmissionLine (to be implemented).
See their documentation for a description of instantiation
and additional attributes.

Attributes
==========

The base attributes for the SpectralLine class are:

================ ================= ========= ========================================

Analysis
========

It is common that one wishes to associate a line with a spectrum
to perform a range of analyses.
This is accomplished through::

   spline.analy['spec'] = sp

where sp is an :ref:`XSpectrum1D` object.

Methods
=======

cut_spec
--------

Provide a spectrum has been associated to the line (see `Analysis`_):
then this method returns the portion of the spectrum surrounding
the line.  The limits are specified by either analy['wvlim'] (in
observed wavelength) or analy['vlim'] with velocities relative
to the line's redshift.  The code returns the flux, error array,
and a *dict* containing the wavelength and velocity arrays.
::

   spline.analy['vlim'] = [-300., 300.]*u.km/u.s
   fx, sig, wv_dict = spline.cut_spec()

ismatch
-------

Check whether two Lines are equal rest wavelength (to 1e-6 AA),
whether they have common RA/DEC to 0.1" (if provided),
and whether they are from the same ion::

   print specline.ismatch(another_line)


measure_ew
----------

Measure the observed Equivalent width for a SpectralLine.
Following absorption-line convention, absorption will
have a positive value and emission will have a negative value.

To perform the calculation, the line must be associated to
a spectrum (see `Analysis_`) and either wvlim or vlim must
be specified.  When executed, the EW and sig_EW attibutes
are filled::

   specline.measure_ew()


measure_restew
--------------

Measure the rest-frame Equivalent width of a SpectralLine.
See `measure_ew`_ for details.

to_dict
-------

Convert the Class to a JSON-friendly dict that might
be easily written to the disk, e.g.::

   adict = specline.to_dict()
   with io.open(outfil, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
      f.write(unicode(json.dumps(tdict, sort_keys=True,
         indent=4, separators=(',', ': '))))
