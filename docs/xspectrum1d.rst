.. index:: XSpectrum1D

Overview
========

`~linetools.spectra.xspectrum1d.XSpectrum1D` describes a 1-d spectrum,
which usually consists of a wavelength, flux and flux uncertainty
array.  For absorption-line analysis, it also often contains a
continuum array.  XSpectrum1D subclasses the
`specutils <https://github.com/astropy/specutils>`_
Spectrum1D class, adding several new attributes and methods.

Attributes
==========

Its main attributes are the `wavelength`, `flux` and
`uncertainty`. Let's create a spectrum using the
`~linetools.spectra.xspectrum1d.XSpectrum1D.from_tuple` method::

    >>> from linetools.spectra.xspectrum1d import XSpectrum1D
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> wa = np.arange(3000, 7000.1, 0.5)
    >>> fl = np.ones_like(wa)
    >>> sig = np.ones_like(fl) * 0.1
    >>> sp = XSpectrum1D.from_tuple((wa, fl, sig))
    >>> sp.wavelength # doctest: +SKIP
    <Quantity [ 3000. , 3000.5, 3001. ,..., 6999. , 6999.5, 7000. ] Angstrom>
    >>> sp.flux
    <Quantity [ 1., 1., 1.,...,  1., 1., 1.]>
    >>> sp.uncertainty # doctest: +SKIP
    <astropy.nddata.nduncertainty.StdDevUncertainty at 0x10bec8e80>
   
Note that the wavelength and flux both have units. If you don't
specify a unit when you create an new XSpectrum1D instance, Angstroms
are assumed. In this case the flux is unitless but still a
Quantity array. The 1-sigma
uncertainty is assumed to have the same units as the flux, and you can
access its underlying numpy array via ``sp.uncertainty.array``
or ``sp.sig``.

Methods
=======

Reading and Writing
-------------------

Read spectra from a file using ``sp.from_file``, which uses the same
syntax as `~linetools.spectra.io.readspec`. The easiest way to create
a new spectrum from data arrays is to use ``sp.from_tuple`` as shown
above.

To write a spectrum to a file, use either `sp.write_to_fits` or
`sp.write_to_ascii`. FITS files are preferable because they are
generally faster to read and write, require less space, and
are generally easier for other software to read.

Plotting
--------

`sp.plot()` plots the spectrum, which you can then navigate around
using the same keys as `~lt_xspec` (as well as the usual matplotlib
navigation tools).
**Note**:  if you are using MacOSX then you will
probably need to change your *backend* from macosx to TkAgg
in the matplotlibrc file.

Rebinning
---------

`~linetools.spectra.xspectrum1d.XSpectrum1D.rebin` rebins the spectrum
to an arbitrary input wavelength array.  Flux is conserved.  If
*do_sig=True*, the error array is rebinned as well and a crude attempt
is made to conserve S/N.  Generally, neighboring pixels will be
correlated::

    >>> newspec = sp.rebin(new_wv, do_sig=True) # doctest: +SKIP


Continuum fitting
-----------------

`~linetools.spectra.xspectrum1d.XSpectrum1D.fit_continuum` enables you
to interactively fit a continuum to the spectrum. Currently it's
optimised to estimate the continuum for high-resolution quasar
spectra, but it should be applicable to any spectrum with a slowly
varying continuum level and narrow absorption features. Once a
continuum has been fitted, it can be accessed using under the `co`
attribute. The spectrum can also be normalised (i.e the flux is
divided by the continuum) with the
`~linetools.spectra.xspectrum1d.XSpectrum1D.normalize`
method. Finally, you can apply small variations to the continuum
anchor points with
`~linetools.spectra.xspectrum1d.XSpectrum1D.perturb_continuum` to see
how changes in the continuum level affect your analysis.


Other methods
-------------

You can join one XSpectrum1D instance with another overlapping
spectrum using `~linetools.spectra.xspectrum1d.XSpectrum1D.splice`.
`~linetools.spectra.xspectrum1d.XSpectrum1D.pix_minmax` finds the
pixel indices corresponding to a wavelength or velocity range, and
`~linetools.spectra.xspectrum1d.XSpectrum1D.add_noise` adds noise to
the spectrum. For a complete list of all the available methods, see
the API: `~linetools.spectra.xspectrum1d.XSpectrum1D`.
